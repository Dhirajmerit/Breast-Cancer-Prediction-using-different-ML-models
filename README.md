# all_MLpackage

## Overview

The `all_MLpackage` is a custom Python package that integrates multiple machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn to build a comprehensive breast cancer detection system. This package allows users to apply various ML algorithms to the same dataset, compare their accuracies, and visualize the results in both graphical and tabular formats. The aim is to detect breast cancer efficiently and to understand which machine learning model performs best for this specific use case.

## Key Features

- Uses multiple scikit-learn algorithms for breast cancer detection.
- Automatically generates accuracy comparison graphs and tables.
- Provides short descriptions of each algorithm, tailored to breast cancer detection.
- User-friendly, well-documented, and easy to integrate with any breast cancer dataset.

## Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
pip install all_MLpackage
